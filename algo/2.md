## BFS

```python
def bfs(graph: list[list[int]], start: int):
    visit = [False] * len(graph)
    q = [start]
    while len(q) != 0:
        i = q[0]
        q = q[1:]
        if visit[i]:
            continue
        visit[i] = True
        for node, connected in enumerate(graph[i]):
            if connected and node != i:
                q.append(node)
    return visit
```

## Edges to Array

```python
    graph = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        graph[i][i] = 1
    for w in wires:
        [a, b] = w
        graph[a-1][b-1] = 1
        graph[b-1][a-1] = 1
```
